Purple implementation
======================

Purple Clock type


Objects of type Clock are recorded in declared Model subclasses
These only have references to the clock's clients
A client reference may point to another clock, or to a rule

On elaboration, a new object of type Clock is created which also
contains the actual client objects (rules) sensitive to the clock
